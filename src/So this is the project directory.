So this is the project directory.

Src contains all project files

assetes folder contains css design sheets images icons and jss files used to design

components folder contains all the custom components used in the app

layout contains app layout, its a single page application and contains only 2 to 3 screens soo is have only one layout name App

services folder contains redux configuration and reducers and actions

common contains common functions used in App like formatting date and history file is used to maintain history of browser

finally views folder contains all the three screens as you can see on left side

index.js is the entry point if application

as you can see i have used history provider and stateprovider in the main entry file so the redux is available in all the app and work accordingly.

routes.js contains all the routes for the 3 pages we have made.

Thats it.

Thank You.
